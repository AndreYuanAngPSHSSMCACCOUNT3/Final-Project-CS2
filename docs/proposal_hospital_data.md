Project Proposal
Project Title:
Hospital Patient Record Analyzer


Problem Statement:

Hospitals handle many patients every day, and it can be difficult to keep track of all their visits and which doctors they have seen. Without an organized system, staff might not easily see who visits most often, which doctors are busiest, or how many total visits happen in a month.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a simple Python program that reads data from a hospital.json file. The program will help organize and summarize patient information, making it easier to understand hospital activity and doctor workloads.

Objectives:

Objective 1: To analyze and summarize patient and doctor data from the hospital JSON file.
Objective 2: To help users see trends such as the most visited doctor and the most frequent patient.
Objective 3: To practice using Python for data analysis and JSON file handling.

Planned Features:

Feature 1: Count how many visits a patient has made. (starter)
Feature 2: List the doctors a patient has consulted. (starter)
Feature 3: Find the patient with the most visits.
Feature 4: Find the most visited doctor.
Feature 5: Compute the average number of visits per doctor.
(Optional Feature 6: Show the most common department or reason for visits.)

Planned Inputs and Outputs:

Inputs:

Patient name (to search their record)

Doctor name (to see their total visits)

Option number from menu (to choose a feature)

Outputs:

Total number of patients

Patient visit counts

List of doctors consulted by each patient

Patient with the most visits

Most visited doctor

Average visits per doctor

Logic Plan:
Start Program
Load the JSON file (hospital.json)
Display a menu with choices:
    1. Count how many visits a patient made
    2. List doctors a patient has consulted
    3. Show patient with the most visits
    4. Show most visited doctor
    5. Show average visits per doctor
Ask the user to choose an option
Use if-else to perform the selected feature
Display results clearly in the console
Ask the user if they want to try another feature
Repeat until the user chooses to exit
End Program
